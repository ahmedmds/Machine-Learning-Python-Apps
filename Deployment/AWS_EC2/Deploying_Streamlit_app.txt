# Place .pem file in any AWS keys folder 
.pem downloaded when Keypair instance is created

# Additional notes,

# Within AWS Linux instance (accessed using Windows CMD)
# After installing Git, the app repository needs to cloned,
# but since the app is in the subdirectory of repository,
# clone the entire repository but then separate the relevant subdirectory and then delete the balance repository
$ git clone https://github.com/<github_user>/Machine-Learning-Python-Apps.git

$ rm -r -f Machine-Learning-Python-Apps/
$ cd Salary_Predictor_App/
... Salary_Predictor_App]$ rm -r -f Procfile setup.sh
# Install packages, run each line so any non-installable package is skipped
... Salary_Predictor_App]$ cat requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 pip3 install
... Salary_Predictor_App]$ streamlit run app.py

# To keep the app running
... Salary_Predictor_App]$ sudo yum install tmux

# Press Ctrl+B and then D (donâ€™t press Ctrl when pressing D) to detach your session from the terminal and keeping it running in the background

# Attach the same session using e.g. to close the app:
... Salary_Predictor_App]$ tmux attach -t SalaryPredictorML

# If app is not starting at port 8501 then it means another instance of a Streamlit is already running at 8501
# Find the process ID for this port
... Salary_Predictor_App]$ ps aux | grep streamlit
... Salary_Predictor_App]$ kill -9 <process_id>

# As an alternative to using CMD to connect from AWS to ssh, use EC2 Instance Connect from browser
# Go to EC2 instances dashboard and click on the instance and then click Connect!
